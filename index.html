            <p class="project-summary">As part of the Web UX team, I led the frontend architecture design and technical implementation of high-traffic, consumer-facing travel products (some featured during the companywide CEO update and in our most recent <a href="https://press.priceline.com/priceline-winter-2024-product-release-blog/" target="_blank" class="link-color">press release</a>), including Alternative Rental Car Supplier Onboarding, Trip Protection in Car and Flights, Packages Full Listings, Rental Car Upgrade in Checkout, and Legacy Cart to Universal Checkout Migration.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">This often involved initiating discussions with stakeholders, communicating across multiple engineering teams across the organization (as well as Business, Marketing, Product, Design, and Analytics), and serving as a technical product manager in creating a backlog of JIRA tickets with descriptions and acceptance criterias for project deliverables.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">My most proud technical contributions include leading the React 18 migration, server-side rendering & hydration (as a technique of using client-side JavaScript to add interactivity to server-rendered HTML), and 12-Factor based web development initiatives.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">I deep dived into ES6 JavaScript, TypeScript, Babel JavaScript Compiler, React (+Redux) JavaScript Library with Modern Hooks, Node (+Express) JavaScript Runtime, GraphQL (+Apollo API Platform) Query Language, Webpack Module Bundler, and Splunk/New Relic/GKE Stackdriver Logging & Monitoring.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">In addition to making active code contributions, I automated development workflows with Github Actions and deployed features with Docker, Harness, and Codefresh (our most recent GitOps based delivery platform).</p>
            <p class="project-summary">I'm also a fan of integrating GenAI into the workspace. ChatGPT has been helpful when helping write unit tests and Codeium with autosuggesting code blocks.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">If you'd like to peek into some of my work, they include:

            <p class="project-title">Hydrogen</p>
            <p class="project-summary">I was part of the core team that built "Hydro: Security & Identity", a blockchain-based identity management app (DApp). It launched for iOS and Android in July 2018.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">Read more about my experience with the team on developing the app with React Native <a href="https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/developing-the-hydro-mobile-app-b0945f610e56" target="_blank" class="link-color">here</a>. We also have a <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/hydro-mobile-app" target="_blank" class="link-color">page</a> on Product Hunt.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">How the 2FA app works:
              <ul class="project-details">
                <li class="project-details-line">It creates a secure Ethereum wallet on your phone and saves your public Ethereum address mapped to a HydroID on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
                <li class="project-details-line">12 seed words are also randomly generated at the time to restore your wallet in case you replace or lose your phone.</li>
                <li class="project-details-line">Every time you authenticate with a linked website by entering a random 6-digit code that is shown on the website into the mobile app, a signed transaction is initiated on the blockchain, our immutable public ledger.</li>
                <li class="project-details-line">Finally, the API checks if the smart contract has validated the transaction and authenticates your identity with the website.</li>
                <li class="project-details-line">Touch ID, facial recognition, and PIN protection are also features offered by the Hydro app to provide you an extra layer of security.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="project-summary">Moreover, I developed sample apps with web3.js, such as this <a href="https://github.com/hydrogen-dev/Hydro-Auth" target="_blank" class="link-color">code</a> which performs authentication via our smart contract. A detailed walk-through of the code is available <a href="https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/authenticating-on-the-blockchain-with-hydro-web3-js-3a7de9cc906b" target="_blank" class="link-color">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">Some of my other projects include demos and admin & analytics tools interacting with our core financial API suite. Our team used React/Redux, Angular1, Node/Express, and C3.js on the frontend.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">I also presented sales demos to potential clients and built technical prototypes at proof-of-concept workshops with other engineers (which included fun work trips to Chile which I am still thankful for!).</p>

            <p class="project-summary">My primary role was building the interfaces of our new investing and wealth management platform. I scaffolded the Angular2 & Node/Express single page application based on the original JavaScript & PHP multi page application.
            <p class="project-summary">Some of the things I built with our team of engineers and designers include data visualizations of client portfolios in d3.js and c3.js, landing page, session management with Redis, and user interfaces of the two-factor authentication app.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">Company closed the investing platform in 2018 and spinned off to a B2B fintech platform called Hydrogen.</p>
